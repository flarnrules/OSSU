# MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

Course started on Aug 30, 2023.
Course ends in November 2023.
I would like to finish this time.

Course uses the `anaconda` development environment.
this course also uses the `spyder` IDE
In order for these to work, I need to activate the `base` virtual environment.

This can be achieved with: `conda activate base`
